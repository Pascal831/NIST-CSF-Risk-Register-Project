# 🛡️ NIST CSF-Aligned Risk Register Project

This project demonstrates the creation of a Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) risk register using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** as a guiding standard. It includes a 10-risk register, visual heatmap, and comprehensive report—all built as part of a hands-on GRC learning lab.

## 📌 Objectives

- Identify and document cybersecurity risks aligned to NIST CSF
- Assign likelihood, impact, and calculate risk scores
- Define risk owners and mitigation controls
- Visualize risks using a heatmap
- Generate a professional PDF report
